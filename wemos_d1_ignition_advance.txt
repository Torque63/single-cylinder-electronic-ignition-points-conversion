In this updated code, the rpmThresholds array now contains 13 RPM thresholds at 500 RPM increments. 
The rest of the code remains the same as before.

In this updated code, the revLimitRPM variable is introduced to specify the maximum RPM limit 
(in this case, set to 6000 RPM). Inside the loop() function, an additional check is performed 
before applying the timing advance. If the RPM exceeds the maximum limit, the rev limiter action is triggered, 
and the MOSFET is turned off to limit the RPM.

Please note that you can adjust the values of timingAdvanceMin, timingAdvanceMax, 
and revLimitRPM to suit your requirements.

On the hardware side this project uses a wemos d1 mini clone, I selected this processor becuase they are 
inexpensive and readily available.
